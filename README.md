# face-swap

## Progress

An example in initial.ipynb file shows the idea of what i am working on now. I am going to do the same but for each triangle of face mesh. It will provide realistic results and work fast.
 
## TODO:
- crop
- grayscale processing
- no landmarks detected asserts
- wrap face alignment into one class
- add face shape and eyebrow zones
- 3D landmarks affine 
- lighting conditions
- split smaller segments of face features
